				<p>I didn't know how I had gone so far I am just a super curious women
				and i don't know what to do, I was lying in bed every day and didn't know anything about life until I saw youtube I saw how to be a programmer and I have been searching for a lot since then and until my thoughts are expanded and dreamed of a lot. And so that's the short paragraph
				why i'm here right now.</p>
